a)	Missing Completely at random (MCAR): 
b)	Missing at random (MAR): 
c)	Missing not at random (RNAR) or Not missing at random (NMAR):

Methods of handling missing data
1)	Conventional methods
a.	Listwise Deletion (or complete case analysis): 
b.	Pairwise Deletion (or Available case analysis): 
c.	Dropping Variables:

2)	Unconditional imputation (Mean, Median, Mode):
3) Linear Regression
4) KNN
5) Multiple imputation
6) Determinitic Regression
7) using MICE Library
